# Overview

As someone who's interested in Video Game Development, I've decided to take a look at the Rust language, which is often useful for more complex game engines. 

The main goal of this software was to get an understanding of the basic building blocks of Rust, working with mutable vs immutable variables, function parameters, and the like. 

It's a text-based adventure game that's based around the idea of having an inventory! Sort of like a point-and-click game, without the pointing or clicking.

# Development Environment

This was made with Visual Studio Code and uploaded to Github for storage.

Made with Rust and the Text_io crate.

# Future Work

If I come back to this in the future, I'd like to do a couple things different. First off, I'd like to make it so that there's multiple paths you could take rather than one singular path you're supposed to take. Beyond that, I'd like to add more content rather than being a short little hike. Lastly, adding some actual puzzles would be nice.
